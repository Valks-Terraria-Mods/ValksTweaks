- All Weapons Auto Reuse (no more manual clicking for items)
- Infinite Ammo (also applies to thrown and magical weapons)
- All Projectile Types Ignore Collision (if true all projectiles will ignore tile collisions)
- Random Projectile Type (a random projectile will be fired from your weapon if it shoots projectiles)
- Projectile Type (override the projectile all weapons will fire, please note that "Random Projectile Type" must be set to false in order for this to work properly. Also note setting this to 0 will disable this feature.)

- Additional Projectiles Left (shoot more projectiles on your left)
- Additional Projectiles Right (shoot more projectiles on your right)

Please note that the "Projectile Type" config option has only been tested for the first 6 values. Numbers greater than this may shoot projectiles that either destroy tiles in your world, spawn lava pockets, or it might be just a ordinary arrow or snowball. Please report all projectile values that cause any kind of problems for you, thank you.

More features may be added later on.
