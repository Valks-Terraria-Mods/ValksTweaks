This mod has several config options
- Use Time Multiplier (lower values means faster fire rates)
- Use Speed Multiplier (how fast the weapon art animation is played)
- All Weapons Auto Reuse (no more manual clicking for items)
- Infinite Ammo (applies to thrown and magical weapons as well)
- All Projectile Types Ignore Collision (if true all projectiles will ignore tile collisions)
- Random Projectile Type (a random projectile will be fired from your weapon if it shoots projectiles)
- Projectile Type (override the projectile all weapons will fire, please note that "Random Projectile Type" must be set to false in order for this to work properly. Also note setting this to 0 will disable this feature.)
- Weapon Damage Multiplier
- Weapon Crit Multiplier
- Weapon Knockback Multiplier
- Item Scale Multiplier (larger values means bigger weapons which means weapons cover a larger damage area)
- Projectile Velocity Multiplier (multiply how fast projectiles will shoot)
- Additional Projectiles Left (shoot more projectiles on your left)
- Additional Projectiles Right (shoot more projectiles on your right)
- Additional Projectile Horizontal Spacing (how far apart additional projectiles are from each other)

Other config options not related to weapons that I decided to add anyways
- Are Tools Effected (if true tools will be affected by all config values)
- Use Animation Multiplier (seems to do the exact same thing as "Use Speed Multiplier", although instead values closer to zero will increase the animation speed. I recommend just changing "Use Speed Multiplier" instead of this.)
- Goblin Reforge Cost Multiplier (modify forge costs, set to 0 for free reforges)
- Horizontal Wing Speed Multiplier
- Horizontal Wing Acceleration Multiplier
- Pickup Range Multiplier

Please note that the "Projectile Type" config option has only been tested for the first 6 values. Numbers greater than this may shoot projectiles that either destroy tiles in your world, spawn lava pockets, or it might be just a ordinary arrow or snowball. Please report all projectile values that cause any kind of problems for you, thank you.

More features may be added later on.
