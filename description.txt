This mod has several config options
- "Use Time Multiplier" (lower values means faster fire rates)
- "Use Speed Multiplier" (how fast the weapon art animation is played)
- "Use Animation Multiplier" (seems to do the exact same thing as "Use Speed Multiplier", although instead values closer to zero will increase the animation speed. I recommend just changing "Use Speed Multiplier" instead of this.)
- "All Weapons Auto Reuse" (if true all weapons will auto fire for you, for example no more manual clicking for the wooden bow)
- "Are Tools Effected" (if true tools will be affected by all config values)
- "Infinite Ammo" (if true all weapons no longer consume ammo, this is also true for thrown and magic weapons)
- "All Projectile Types Ignore Collision" (if true all projectiles will ignore tile collisions)
- "Random Projectile Type" (a random projectile will be fired from your weapon if it shoots projectiles)
- "Projectile Type" (override the projectile all weapons will fire, please note that "Random Projectile Type" must be set to false in order for this to work properly. Also note setting this to 0 will disable this feature.)
- "Projectile Damage Multiplier" (multiply how much damage projectiles will do)
- "Projectile Velocity Multiplier" (multiply how faster projects will shoot)
- "Additional Projectiles Left" (how many additional projectiles will be shot on the left of the player)
- "Additional Projectiles Right" (how many additional projectiles will be shot on the right of the player)
- "Additional Projectile Horizontal Spacing" (how far apart additional projectiles are from each other)
- "Goblin Reforge Cost Multiplier" (modify forge costs, set to 0 for free reforges)

Please note that the "Projectile Type" config option has only been tested for the first 6 values. Numbers greater than this may shoot projectiles that either destroy tiles in your world, spawn lava pockets, or it might be just a ordinary arrow or snowball. Please report all projectile values that cause any kind of problems for you, thank you.

More features may be added later on.
